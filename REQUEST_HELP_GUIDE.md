Subject: Request: Build Android APK (WorkTime Pro Project)

Hi [IT Admin Name],

I'm working on an Android project called "WorkTime Pro" and need to build an APK file.

I don't have administrator privileges to install Android Studio on my laptop.

Could you please help me with one of these options:

OPTION A: Install Android Studio on my laptop
- This would allow me to build APKs for future projects as well

OPTION B: Build the APK for me (5 minutes)
- Project location: C:\Users\Intern Engineering 1\Downloads\WorkTimePro
- Command to run: gradlew.bat assembleDebug
- Output will be at: app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk

OPTION C: Grant temporary admin rights
- Just for Android Studio installation

The project is ready to build - all dependencies are configured.

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## 📧 **OPTION 2: Request Template for Manager**

```
Subject: Software Installation Request: Android Studio

Hi [Manager Name],

I'm working on an Android development project (WorkTime Pro) as part of my learning/internship tasks.

To complete this project, I need Android Studio installed on my laptop:
- Software: Android Studio (Free, Official Google IDE)
- Download: https://developer.android.com/studio
- Size: ~1 GB installer, ~3 GB installed
- Purpose: Build Android APK files

Could you approve this installation or arrange it with IT?

Alternatively, if installation isn't possible, I can:
1. Use cloud build services (GitHub Actions)
2. Use a different computer with Android Studio
3. Request one-time build assistance from IT

Please let me know the best approach.

Thank you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## 💬 **OPTION 3: Quick Message to Colleague**

```
Hey [Colleague Name]!

Quick question - do you have Android Studio installed on your laptop?

I built an Android app (WorkTime Pro) and just need to build the APK.
It takes literally 2 minutes if you have Android Studio.

Could you help me build it?

Steps:
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open my project folder
3. Build → Build APK
4. Done!

The project is at: C:\Users\Intern Engineering 1\Downloads\WorkTimePro

(Or I can copy it to a USB drive and bring it to your desk)

Let me know if you're free for 5 mins!

Thanks!
```

## 🎯 **OPTION 4: Ask a Developer Friend**

```
Hey!

Could you help me build an Android APK? 

I have a complete Kotlin project but don't have Android Studio installed (no admin access on work laptop).

Can I send you the project files? You just need to:
1. Open in Android Studio
2. Build → Build APK
3. Send me the APK file

Takes 2-3 minutes!

The project is WorkTime Pro - a simple time calculation app.
All dependencies are configured, should build without issues.

Want me to send you the project folder?

Thanks!
